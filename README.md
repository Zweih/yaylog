# yaylog

`yaylog` is a CLI util, written in **Go** / **Golang**, for [arch linux](https://archlinux.org) and arch-based linux distros to query installed packages.

despite the name, it's not limited to `yay` and works with any package manager that uses ALPM; so it can be used with `pacman`, `yay`, `paru`, `aura`, `pamac`, and even `yaourt` if you're somehow still using it.

you can find installation instructions [here](#installation).

`yaylog` supports querying/sorting for install date, package name, install reason (explicit/dependency), size on disk, reverse dependencies, dependency requirements, and more. check [usage](#usage) for all available options.

## installation

### from AUR (**recommended**)
install using [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers) like `yay`:
```bash
yay -S yaylog
```

if you prefer to install a pre-compiled binary* using the AUR, use the `yaylog-bin` package instead.

***note**: binaries are automatically, securely, and transparently compiled with github CI when a version release is created. you can audit the binary creation by checking the relevant github action for each release version.

for the latest (unstable) version from git w/ the AUR, use `yaylog-git`*.  

***note**: this is not recommended for most users 


### building from source + manual installation
**note**: this packages is specific to arch-based linux distributions

1. clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zweih/yaylog.git
   cd yaylog
   ```
2. build the binary:
   ```bash
   go build -o yaylog ./cmd/yaylog
   ```
3. copy the binary to your system's `$PATH`:
   ```bash
   sudo install -m755 yaylog /usr/bin/yaylog
   ```
4. copy the manpage:
   ```bash
   sudo install -m644 yaylog.1 /usr/share/man/man1/yaylog.1
   ```

## usage

```bash
yaylog [options]
```

### options
- `-l <number>` | `--limit <number>`: limit the amount of recent packages to display (default: 20)
- `-a` | `all`: show all installed packages (ignores `-l`)
- `-w <field>=<value>` | `--where <field>=<value>`: apply multiple queries for a flexible query system. can be used multiple times. example:
  - `--where size=10MB:1GB`    -> query by size range
  - `--where date=2024-01-01:` -> query by installation date
  - `--where reason=explicit`  -> query by explicit installations
  - `--where name=firefox`     -> query by package names that contain `firefox`
  - `--where required-by=vlc`  -> query by packages required by `vlc`
  - `--where depends=glibc`    -> query by packages that depend on `glibc`
  - `--where conflicts=sdl2`   -> query by packages that conflict with `sdl2`
  - `--where arch=x86_64`      -> query by packages that are built for `x86_64` CPUs
- `-O` | `--order <mode>`: sort results by:
  - `date` (default) - sort by installation date
  - `alphabetical` - sort alphabetically by package name
  - `size:asc` / `size:desc` - sort by package size (ascending or descending)
- `--no-headers`: omit column headers in table output (useful for scripting)
- `-s` | `--select <list>`: comma-separated list of fields to display (cannot use with `--select-all` or `--select-add`)
- `-S` | `--select-add <list>`: comma-separated list of fields to add to defaults or `--select-all`
- `-A` | `--select-all`: output all available fields (overrides defaults)
- `--full-timestamp`: display the full timestamp (date and time) of package installations instead of just the date
- `--json`: output results in JSON format (overrides table output and `--full-timestamp`)
- `--no-progress`: force no progress bar outside of non-interactive environments
- `-h` | `--help`: print help info

### querying with `--where`
the `--where` (short-flag: `-w`) flag allow for powerful querying of installed packages. queries can be combined by using multiple query flags. 

all queries that take package/library/program names as arguments can also take a comma-separated list. this applies to the queries `name`, `depends`, and `required-by`. 

short-flag queries and long-flag queries can be combined.

#### available queries
| query type  | syntax | description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| **date** | `date=<value>` | query by installation date. supports exact dates, ranges (`YYYY-MM-DD:YYYY-MM-DD`), and open-ended ranges (`YYYY-MM-DD:` or `:YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| **required by** | `required-by=<package>` / <br> `required-by=<package-1>,<package-2>,<etc>` | query by packages that are required by the specified packages |
| **depends** | `depends=<package>` / <br> `depends=<package-1>,<package-2>,<etc>` | query by packages that have the specified packages as dependencies |
| **provides** | `provides=<package>` / <br> `provides=<package-1>,<package-2>,<etc>` | query by package that provide the specified packages/libraries |
| **conflicts** | `conflicts=<package>` / <br> `conflicts=<package-1,<package-2>,<etc>` | query by packages that conflict with the specified packages |
| **architecture** | `arch=<architecture>` / <br> `arch=<architecture-1>,<architecture-2>,<etc>` | query by packages that are built for the specified architectures <br> **note**: "any" is a separate architecture category |
| **name** | `name=<package>` / <br> `name=<package-1>,<package-2>,<etc>` | query by package name (substring match) |
| **installation reason** | `reason=explicit` / `reason=dependencies` | query packages by installation reason: explicitly installed or installed as a dependency |
| **size** | `size=<value>` | query by package size on disk. supports exact values (`10MB`), ranges (`10MB:1GB`), and open-ended ranges (`:500KB`, `1GB:`) |

### available fields
- `date` - installation date of the package
- `name` - package name
- `reason` - installation reason (explicit/dependency)
- `size` - package size on disk
- `version` - installed package version
- `depends` - list of dependencies (output can be long)
- `required-by` - list of packages required by the package and are dependent (output can be long) 
- `provides` - list of alternative package names or shared libraries provided by package (output can be long)
- `conficts` - list of packages that conflict, or cause problems, with the package
- `arch` - architecture the package was built for (e.g., x86_64, aarch64, any)
- `license` - package software license
- `url` - the URL of the official site of the software being packaged
- `description` - package description

### JSON output
the `--json` flag outputs the package data as structured JSON instead of a table. this can be useful for scripts or automation.

example:
```bash
yaylog -Aw name=tinysparql --json
```

`tinysparql` is one of the few packages that actually has all the fields populated.

output format:
```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": 1739294218,
    "size": 4385422,
    "name": "tinysparql",
    "reason": "dependency",
    "version": "3.8.2-2",
    "arch": "aarch64",
    "license": "GPL-2.0-or-later",
    "url": "https://tinysparql.org/",
    "description": "Low-footprint RDF triple store with SPARQL 1.1 interface",
    "depends": [
      "avahi",
      "gcc-libs",
      "glib2",
      "glibc",
      "icu",
      "json-glib",
      "libsoup3",
      "libstemmer",
      "libxml2",
      "sqlite"
    ],
    "provides": [
      "tracker3=3.8.2",
      "libtinysparql-3.0.so=0-64"
    ],
    "conflicts": [
      "tracker3<=3.7.3-2"
    ]
  }
]
```

### tips & tricks

- when using multiple short flags, the -l flag must be last since it consumes the next argument.
this follows standard unix-style flag parsing, where positional arguments (like numbers)
are treated as separate parameters.
  
  invalid:
  ```bash
  yaylog -wa name=yay  # incorrect usage 
  ```
  valid:
  ```bash
  yaylog -aw name=yay  # correct usage
  ```

- the `depends`, `provides`, `required-by` columns output can be lengthy, packages like `glibc` are required by thousands of packages. to improve readability, pipe the output to tools like `less` or `moar` (i prefer `moar`, but `less` is a core-util):
  ```bash
  yaylog -s name,depends | less
  ```
- all options that take an argument can also be used in the `--<flag>=<argument>` format:
  ```bash
  yaylog -w size=100MB:1GB -w date=:2024-06-30 --limit=100
  yaylog -w name=gtk -O=alphabetical
  ```
  boolean flags can also be explicitly set using `--<flag>=true` or `--<flag>=false`:
  ```bash
  yaylog --no-headers=true --no-progress=true
  ```
  string arguments can also be surrounded with quotes or double-quotes:
  ```bash
  yaylog --order="alphabetical" -w name="vim"
  ```

  this can be useful for scripts and automation where you might want to avoid any and all ambiguity.

  **note**: `--no-progress` is automatically set to `true` when in a non-interactive environment, so you can pipe `|` into programs like `cat`, `grep`, or `less` without issue

- the `--no-headers` flag is useful when processing output in scripts. It removes the header row, making it easier to parse package lists with tools like `awk`, `sed`, or `cut`:
  ```bash
  yaylog --no-headers --columns name,size | awk '{print $1, $2}'
  ```
