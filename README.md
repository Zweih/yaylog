# yaylog

`yaylog` is a CLI util, written in **Go** / **Golang**, for (arch linux)[https://archlinux.org] and arch-based linux distros to sort/filter installed packages.

despite the name, it's not limited to `yay` and works with any package manager that uses ALPM; so it can be used with `pacman`, `yay`, `paru`, `aura`, `pamac`, and even `yaourt` if you're somehow still using it.

`yaylog` supports optional filters/sorting for install date, package name, install reason (explicit/dependency), size on disk, reverse dependencies, dependency requirements, and more. check [usage](#usage) for all available options.

## features

- list installed packages with date/timestamps, dependencies, provisions, requirements, size on disk, and version
- display package versions 
- filter results by explicitly installed packages
- filter results by packages installed as dependencies

## why is it called yaylog if it works with other AUR helpers?
because yay is my preferred AUR helper and the name has a good flow.

## installation

### from AUR (**recommended**)
install using [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers) like `yay`:
```bash
yay -S yaylog
```

if you prefer to install a pre-compiled binary* using the AUR, use the `yaylog-bin` package instead.

***note**: binaries are automatically, securely, and transparently compiled with github CI when a version release is created. you can audit the binary creation by checking the relevant github action for each release version.

for the latest (unstable) version from git w/ the AUR, use `yaylog-git`*.  

***note**: this is not recommended for most users 


### building from source + manual installation
**note**: this packages is specific to arch-based linux distributions

1. clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zweih/yaylog.git
   cd yaylog
   ```
2. build the binary:
   ```bash
   go build -o yaylog ./cmd/yaylog
   ```
3. copy the binary to your system's `$PATH`:
   ```bash
   sudo install -m755 yaylog /usr/bin/yaylog
   ```
4. copy the manpage:
   ```bash
   sudo install -m644 yaylog.1 /usr/share/man/man1/yaylog.1
   ```

## usage

```bash
yaylog [options]
```

### options
- `-n <number>` | `--number <number>`: number of recent packages to display (default: 20)
- `-a` | `all`: show all installed packages (ignores `-n`)
- `-e` | `--explicit`: show only explicitly installed packages
- `-d` | `--dependencies`: show only packages installed as dependencies
- `--date <filter>`: filter packages by installation date. Supports:
  - `YYYY-MM-DD` - show packages installed on the specified date
  - `YYYY-MM-DD:` - show packages installed on or after the date
  - `:YYYY-MM-DD` - show packages installed up to the date
  - `YYYY-MM-DD:YYYY-MM-DD` - show packages installed within a date range
- `--size <filter>`: filter packages by size on disk. Supports:
  - `10MB` - show packages exactly 10MB in size
  - `5GB:` - show packages 5GB and larger
  - `:20KB` - show packages up to 20KB
  - `1.5MB:2GB` - show packages between 1.5MB and 2GB
  - valid units: B (bytes), KB, MB, GB
- `--name <search-term>`: filter packages by name (substring match)
  - example: `gtk` matches `gtk3`, `libgtk`, etc.
- `--sort <mode>`: sort results by:
  - `date` (default) - sort by installation date
  - `alphabetical` - sort alphabetically by package name
  - `size:asc` / `size:desc` - sort by package size (ascending or descending)
- `--no-headers`: omit column headers in table output (useful for scripting)
- `--columns <list>`: comma-separated list of columns to display (cannot use with `--all-columns` or `--add-columns`)
- `--add-columns <list>`: comma-separated list of columns to add to defaults or `all-columns`
- `--all-columns`: show all available columns in the output (overrides defaults)
- `--full-timestamp`: display the full timestamp (date and time) of package installations instead of just the date
- `--json`: output results in JSON format (overrides table output and `--full-timestamp`)
- `--no-progress`: force no progress bar outside of non-interactive environments
- `--required-by <package-name>`: show only packages that are required by the specified package
- `-h` | `--help`: print help info

### available columns
- `date` - installation date of the package
- `name` - package name
- `reason` - installation reason (explicit/dependency)
- `size` - package size on disk
- `version` - installed package version
- `depends` - list of dependencies (output can be long)
- `required-by` - list of packages required by the package and are dependent (output can be long) 
- `provides` - list of alternative package names or shared libraries provided by package (output can be long)

### JSON output
the `--json` flag outputs the package data as structured JSON instead of a table. this can be useful for scripts or automation.

example:
```bash
yaylog --name sqlite --all-columns --json
```

`sqlite` is one of the few packages that actually has all the fields populated.

output format:
```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-02-26T16:33:47Z",
    "name": "sqlite",
    "reason": "dependency",
    "size": 21074944,
    "version": "3.48.0-2",
    "depends": [
      "readline",
      "zlib",
      "glibc"
    ],
    "requiredBy": [
      "docker",
      "gnupg",
      "libsoup3",
      "nss",
      "openslide",
      "tinysparql",
      "util-linux-libs"
    ],
    "provides": [
      "sqlite3=3.48.0",
      "libsqlite3.so=0-64"
    ]
  }
]
```

### tips & tricks

- when using multiple short flags, the -n flag must be last since it consumes the next argument.
this follows standard unix-style flag parsing, where positional arguments (like numbers)
are treated as separate parameters.
  
  invalid:
  ```bash
  yaylog -ne 15  # incorrect usage 
  ```
  valid:
  ```bash
  yaylog -en 15
  ```

- the `depends`, `provides`, `required-by` columns output can be lengthy, packages like `glibc` are required by thousands of packages. to improve readability, pipe the output to `less`:
  ```bash
  yaylog --columns name,depends | less
  ```
- all options that take an argument can also be used in the `--<flag>=<argument>` format:
  ```bash
  yaylog --size=100MB:1GB --date=:2024-06-30 --number=100
  yaylog --name=gtk --sort=alphabetical
  ```
  boolean flags can also be explicitly set using `--<flag>=true` or `--<flag>=false`:
  ```bash
  yaylog --explicit=true --dependencies=false --no-progress=true
  ```
  string arguments can also be surrounded with quotes or double-quotes:
  ```bash
  yaylog --sort="alphabetical" --name="vim"
  ```

  this can be useful for scripts and automation where you might want to avoid any and all ambiguity.

  **note**: `--no-progress` is automatically set to `true` when in a non-interactive environment, so you can pipe `|` into programs like `cat`, `grep`, or `less` without issue

- the `--no-headers` flag is useful when processing output in scripts. It removes the header row, making it easier to parse package lists with tools like `awk`, `sed`, or `cut`:
  ```bash
  yaylog --no-headers --columns name,size | awk '{print $1, $2}'
  ```
