# yaylog (archived)

This project has been renamed to [`qp`](https://github.com/Zweih/qp) (for "query packages").

The codebase, history, and all features are the same. Only the name has changed.

## Why does this repo still exist?

This repository remains online only to prevent broken AUR downloads and source links (like `yaylog.tar.gz`) from failing for users who haven't yet updated.

Please switch to [`qp`](https://github.com/Zweih/qp) for all development, releases, issues, and discussions.
